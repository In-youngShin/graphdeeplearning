# Repository for the project, "Detecting Bridging Nodes and Weak Ties in Social Networks using Graph Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis of GCN and Node2Vec Algorithms"

Social interactions and information dissemination is key for understanding human behaviors and structures of our society, and graph analysis offers a powerful lens through which to comprehend these dynamics. By representing individuals as nodes and their interactions as edges within a graph, a nuanced understanding of relationships and network structures within groups, organizations, and society at large can be achieved.

Granovetter's theory on weak ties illuminates the importance of connections among acquaintances from different social circles who have infrequent interactions. His research revealed that individuals seeking job opportunities were more likely to discover new prospects through acquaintances rather than close friends or family. Granovetter explained this phenomenon by incorporating the concepts of graph theory. According to his explanation, the connections between these acquaintances act as bridges, linking distinct communities and facilitating the diffusion of information. People are more prone to acquiring novel information, shared by other communities, through acquaintances rather than family and friends who belong to the same community. Granovetter conceptualized this phenomenon as the "strength of weak ties." His insights have since been widely embraced to elucidate the diffusion of information and innovation within groups, organizations, and society at large. 

However, as social networks expand in size, detecting weak ties becomes challenging. The proliferation of communication technologies enables individuals to establish connections with millions of others, necessitating a novel approach to understanding and identifying weak ties within large-scale social networks. Graph neural networks present an avenue for addressing this challenge, offering techniques to model and detect nodes comprised of weak ties effectively. In this project, I aim to apply two representative algorithms in Graph neural networks into the tasks detecting weak ties and discusses how these two algorithms are effectively applied in real-world problems. 

The repositories contain all relevant codes and data for this project.
